                <h1>901 North Penn Street Philadelphia</h1>
                <p>Get ready, Northern Liberties! Something significant is coming to 901 North Penn Street. A brand-new development is about to pop up where an empty lot used to be, and this complex is not just another cookie-cutter structure. HDO Architecture has put a great deal of thought into the design to make certain that it not only complements the surrounding area but also stands out as a modern piece of architecture. It's going to be seven stories tall and have 193 units for residential use. That's a lot of new neighbors!</p>

                <p>The top part, or the six floors above the ground, will have a mix of shiny metal and wood-like panels on its exterior. This is to give it a modern and stylish appearance. There will be white metal strips going up and down the building and coming together in frames around the large windows. The other part of the building will be a darker color. Together, the white and dark colors give the building a sharper appearance. It'll actually match the building next door so that it will blend in nicely with the whole block.
                </p>
                <p>The ground floor will feature brick cladding, which adds a touch of traditional charm to the otherwise modern design, and it will have some large floor-to-ceiling windows to enhance visual appeal and let in a significant amount of natural light. However, there won't be any stores. Some say that failing to add retail spaces to the lower level of the building is a missed opportunity to create more cashflow and engage with the community. There is hope, however, that consideration will be given to adding coffee shops and other stores in the future. Additionally, the inclusion of a curb cut, which is necessary for vehicle access, somewhat diminishes the potential for creating a pedestrian-friendly environment.</p>
                <p>Even so, the developers have made some effort to soften the impact of the building on the streetscape by including several street trees along the ground floor. These trees will not only add greenery to the area, but they will also help create a more pleasant environment for pedestrians. It is small touches like these that demonstrate to the community that the developers are thinking about the bigger picture, even if the lack of retail space and curb cuts are less than ideal.</p>
                <p>Parking is often a hot topic when it comes to new developments, and 901 North Penn Street is no exception. The ground level of the building will include 75 parking spaces to meet the needs of the residents in the building. Among these parking spots, two of them will be designated as ADA spaces to accommodate those with disabilities, and four of these will be reserved for electric vehicles to reflect a growing trend towards enhancing environmental sustainability and the need to cater to electric vehicle owners.</p>
                <p>In addition to car parking, the building will also feature 65 bike spaces. This is great news for cyclists and those who prefer greener modes of transport. Northern Liberties is a bike-friendly area, and having dedicated bike storage will undoubtedly appeal to those who enjoy cycling around the city.</p>
                <p>The new project isn't just about creating more apartments for people to occupy. It's about creating a great place to live. The builders are wise because they're setting aside some green space for residents to hang out outside to get some fresh air and catch some sun rays.</p>
                <p>One of the most notable outdoor features will be the amenity space, which will likely include seating areas, landscaping and possibly even a communal garden. This space will provide residents with a place to relax and unwind, and best of all, they can do all of this without having to leave the comfort of their own building. Additionally, there will be a designated dog run to cater to pet owners and their four-legged friends. In a city where green space can be limited, these outdoor amenities are a valuable addition to the development.</p>
                <p>However, it is worth mentioning that a sizable portion of the site will be used for surface parking. This decision might raise some concerns among those who are hoping to see more green space or additional residential units in the area. While parking is undoubtedly important, there is always the hope that in the future, this surface parking could be repurposed to add more density to the site. Some hope consideration will be given to creating additional housing or recreational areas.</p>
                <p>Originally, developers had big plans for that empty lot where the new building will now be situated, such as wanting to construct multiple high-rise towers similar to the ones next store at Waterfront Square, a large residential development that includes three high-rise towers. Unfortunately, things didn't go as expected. Money problems got in the way, so the original plans were never realized. The spot has been empty for a long time, and it's been an eyesore to an otherwise vibrant area. Now, something good is finally happening because the new building is going to change everything. It's like a fresh start for the community.</p>
                <p>While it may not be as tall or as grand as the high-rise towers that developers originally planned for the site, it still represents a major improvement over the current state of the property. This development will bring new life to a long-neglected corner of this area. It will be interesting to see how the development progresses and whether any additional changes are made to the site in the future.</p>
                <p>As the project moves forward, it will be interesting to see how it impacts the area and whether it spurs further development in the Northern Liberties community. It will also be exciting to see if new enhancements are made in the coming years that include additional amenities for residents.</p>
