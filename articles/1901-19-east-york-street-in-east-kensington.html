                <h1>1901-19 East York Street in East Kensington</h1>
                <p>To say that there’s a lot of development taking place in and around East Kensington today would be an understatement. The last few years have seen the York-Dauphin Station area go from a sea of vacant lots to a large construction zone. Mark you, we are talking about buildings that have already been completed and others that are in different stages of completion. Our analysis shows that there are close to 600 units worth of massive projects in the pipeline. And this does not factor in the smaller infill developments! Today, we want to introduce you to the new development at 1901-19 East York Street, which will help add 127 new units to this count. </p>

                <p>Designed by LRK, this new development will be constructed at what was once known as the IRMX-zoned surface parking lot. The lot measures an impressive 23,889 square feet. According to data from LRK, this six-story building will be 72 feet tall, 109,231 square feet, and will house 127 residential units. East Kensington residents will have the option to buy an artist studio or a unit measuring 6,080 square feet. Occupants of this new development will have access to fifty four bicycle stalls, twenty seven parking spaces, a gym, and a roof deck.</p>
                <p>Other notable features worth mentioning include the balconies, elevator service, and a green roof. Its roof deck promises to provide sweeping skyline views, which will help give the development prominence over other upcoming buildings. A look at the permit list shows that Equinox Management and Construction are the lead contractors for this project.</p>
                <p>As far as the design goes, we must say that this development looks better than what we have seen coming up in recent days. More importantly, it helps in complementing the industrial background of this neighborhood. Per the rendering released by its planners, the primary part of its façade will comprise red brick with metal canopies. It will also have balconies in all units, including industrial-style windows. The designers have included grey brick, blue and grey fiber cement panels, and grey and black corrugated metal to help complete this façade.</p>
                <p>According to the construction plan, seven two-story townhouse-style units along Boston Street and along York Street will have private street entrances. Residents can also look forward to some curb cuts along both streets for the parking garage. Sitting at the center of the building will be a 4,780-square-foot courtyard for all residents.</p>
                <p>Our first look at the project reveals that this is a brilliant project that will add significant value to the surrounding community. The fact that it sits a mere block away from the York-Dauphin El Station makes it an instant hit with anyone looking to live in the all-inclusive community. Many agree that there’s no better place to add residential units than 400 feet away from a busy subway stop. We assume the LRK development team would have liked to forego the parking but were required to include twenty seven spaces due to the minimums specified by the zoning code. From everything we have seen in the new upcoming development, we can say that the curb cuts are the only major drawbacks to it.
                </p>
                <p>The good news, however, is that its permits have already been issued, and construction already begun. News from the developer indicates that construction is nearing completion, with the building having reached its final height of slightly over 70 feet.</p>
                <p>Upon completion, the new development coming at 1901-19 East York Street in East Kensington will provide a robust design with a heavy traditional influence. This will come as a welcome addition to the city’s landscape, thanks in part to its offering of 100+ residential units. So, we are looking forward to seeing the kind of added energy this and other upcoming developments will bring to the city of Kensington. As we advance, we can only assume that the York-Dauphin Station will continue to experience a big increase in commuters as these developments start to lease up. Remember, these are developments that are helping revitalize a neighborhood that hasn’t experienced any noticeable growth in decades.</p>
