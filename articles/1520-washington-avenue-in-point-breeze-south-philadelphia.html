                <h1>1520 Washington Avenue in Point Breeze, South Philadelphia</h1>
                <p>Finding a new apartment in one of the oldest cities in the United States can be tough! Thanks to the new development at 1520 Washington Avenue in Point Breeze in South Philadelphia, you can enjoy the wonderful features available when you move into a new development in an established neighborhood.</p>
                <p>The new building offers 55 apartments and more than 70 parking spots. Expectations are that, while some residents won't need a parking spot, many businesses will need more than one. ADA parking is also included in the plan.</p>

                <p>Those with mobility issues will note that this building won't need to be retrofitted for access. Since it's new construction, doorway access and appropriate clearance will be incorporated into the design. This seven-story building will feature commercial space on the bottom two floors and housing above. This combination of retail and residential is a terrific addition to the neighborhoodâ€™s real estate market.</p>
                <p>One of the loveliest features about this planned development is that it will promote pedestrian traffic. Instead of walking by plain brick facades that don't invite pedestrians to linger, walkers in the neighborhood will stroll by tall windows that provide a view into the retail establishments that set up on the first floor of this building. A heavy duty steel canopy will shield pedestrians from weather as they stroll, shop and enjoy the offerings of main floor retailers.</p>
                <p>Though it's a new building, it doesn't have the appearance of a new building; it won't appear to be badly out of place. Philadelphia, particularly the commercial areas of the city, has undergone many unique changes. Once all the square footage at street level filled up, designers went to work creating overbuilds. These construction projects added stories to the top of existing buildings for additional, and generally lighter, use. This upper construction may have been created for housing to be used by the business owner, or it could have simply included a storage loft.</p>
                <p>Overbuilds added stories on top of the buildings that could handle the weight. They were made up of lighter materials and often included more windows than the bottom of the building offered. While the new construction at 1520 Washington Avenue is all new and all being built at the same time, it has the look of an old-style overbuild, thanks to the corrugated metal panels above the brickwork of the first five stories.</p>
                <p>The first five stories will be constructed of a medium-brown brick. Unlike older industrial buildings in the area, all stories will feature large windows to provide shops and apartments plenty of light. The top two floors will feature a dark metal corrugated paneling for durability in any weather. This building will not stick out or appear out of place and time. Instead, it will provide residents and businesses the chance to mesh well with the rest of the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>The housing market in Philadelphia is tight, as in many of the larger cities of the United States. The average rent for an apartment in Philadelphia is approximately $2,000 and tenants will enjoy around <a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/pa/philadelphia-county/philadelphia/south-philadelphia/" target="_blank">800 square feet</a> of living space.</p>
                <p>If you're looking for a great apartment in a newly constructed building featuring fresh designs and new fixtures, be ready to act when the leases come available on these apartments. The entire real estate market in south Philadelphia is warming up. The combination of commercial and residential living space will make the apartments at 1520 Washington Avenue quite popular.</p>
                <p>In addition to the readily accessible retail spaces on the first two floors, tenants of 1520 Washington Avenue will appreciate amenities such as the planned terrace featured in the renderings. Covered parking is also part of the construction plan.</p>
                <p>There are many conveniences near this new development. You can easily get a great cup of coffee, buy your groceries and even do some browsing at Target. With so many options in walking distance, you can save fuel and get your steps in! As the development at Broad and Washington continues to grow, you'll find plenty of places to visit and to shop.</p>
                <p>While access to the growing Broad and Washington development will certainly be convenient, residents at 1520 Washington Avenue will enjoy a break from construction disruption. You'll have room to stroll, ready access to your parking garage and a quiet place to call home.</p>
