                <h1>1201-15 Callowhill Street</h1>
                <p>An innovative mixed-use complex is planned for 1201-15 Callowhill Street in Lower North Philadelphia. The approved plans for the new complex reveal a modern six-story building that will house an underground garage, retail space, office sites, and co-living spaces. This unique design, crafted by the professionals at JKRP Architects, is visually appealing and environmentally friendly. With its co-living design, which may include almost 240 beds, the complex is set to attract a diverse range of residents, from young professionals to students and digital nomads.</p>

                <p>JKRP Architects is a Philadelphia-based company that opened its doors in 1984. A nearby project they have recently been working on is redeveloping the Royal Theater in Center City. This project required the team to keep the theater's facade because of its historical significance. Yet, they gutted the inside, as water had extensively damaged the building. They have already designed several apartments, co-living units and senior living complexes throughout New England.</p>
                <p>The Callowhill building will be visually attractive. The architectural team designed it to be constructed of white materials with brown panels interspersed to add visual interest. Unlike older apartment buildings, this complex will feature staggered windows. The windows on the ground floor, where lessees can put their businesses, will have ground-to-ceiling windows to let in as much natural light as possible.</p>
                <p>Residents rent bedrooms to make the space attractive to younger people and those living a mobile lifestyle. Then, they share common living spaces, such as the kitchen, bath and living room. Housekeepers keep these areas clean, helping to free up time for other pursuits. Often, utilities, including internet, are included with the rent in these complexes. Co-living spaces are usually more affordable for living in a desired area. Others love that most housekeeping duties are performed for them, giving them more time to work and play. Still others prefer living in co-living spaces, which allows them to create a smaller footprint.</p>
                <p>One of the key attractions of this complex is its prime location between 12th Street and 13th Street. Situated in the vibrant Callowhill neighborhood, near Old Town and North Liberty, residents will easily access various attractions, adding to the development's urban flair. The location is near the Reading Terminal Market, the Barnes Foundation, and the Franklin Institute. Access to Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority options makes it convenient for residents, merchants, and shoppers to reach this up-and-coming neighborhood.</p>
                <p>A main draw for residents moving to the complex will be Rail Park, which will be directly adjacent to the development. Many of the rooms in the building will overlook this beautiful green space, which is being developed as a joint partnership between private donors and the government using grants and gifts. It is the former home of part of the Reading Viaduct, part of the Reading Railroad. Landscapers are designing the area using native plants. The park's developers hope that community events will occur often at this location. Residents with bedrooms with north or east views should be able to see the park from their units. Landscapers are installing native plants and workers have installed walkways and benches, making this a great place to relax.</p>
                <p>When the architects released the initial plans and got the necessary permits in 2021, the total construction cost was listed at $17.2 million. Therefore, it should be a great addition to the quickly developing neighborhood. This area of Philadelphia has an industrial past, but its affordability makes it an attractive option for many types of startups. Therefore, developers hope retail and office space will fill quickly. The developers' primary emphasis has been on creating a green building. They hope to get the building green-certified, with a particular focus on environmentally friendly lighting options. Additionally, they have included spaces for bicycles in the parking garage.</p>
                <p>The planned development at 1201-15 Callowhill Street represents a significant investment in Lower North Philadelphia's urban landscape. With its mix of co-living spaces, retail and office areas, and ample parking and bicycle facilities, this project is poised to become a central feature of the neighborhood. Residents may be drawn to this location because of the neighborhood's co-living affordability and the thought of leaving a smaller footprint. Many people may find that they love living next to a green oasis while still being able to commute easily, and there are plenty of places to explore in the neighborhood. Its prime location, combined with direct access to the elevated Rail Park and proximity to key transit routes, ensures that it will be a highly sought-after address for residents seeking both convenience and a vibrant urban lifestyle. Merchants will love the light-filled retail spaces in this high-traffic area, while those looking for office space will find ample amenities. At the same time, the architects have attempted to keep the building as green as possible.</p>
