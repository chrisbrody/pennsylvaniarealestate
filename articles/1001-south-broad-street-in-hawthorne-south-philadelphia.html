                <p>Recently, the Hawthorne part of South Philly has been attracting a lot of attention from residents who are serious about making the most out of the City of Brotherly Love. Nearby artwork and upscale eateries let you know that you're in a booming metropolis, but the energy in the neighborhood evokes more of that cozy vibe for which the city is so well-known. For those who need to commute, the location is also extremely favorable. With both the 76 and 95 within a short distance, residents of this extraordinary new development won't have to worry about gridlock very often.</p>
                <p>For city dwellers who prefer not to have a car, this area is particularly amazing. Do you want something tasty to eat? Stroll over to the famed Italian Market on 9th Street, and revel in what many consider to be the best cuisine on the East Coast. Are you craving a famous South Philly cheesesteak? You'll be delighted to discover that both of the iconic Philly cheesesteak shops — Geno's and Pat's — are within walking distance. The proximity to Center City is also another major selling point of this area. Philly's business community is coming back in a big way, and many large companies have decided to set up shop in Center City, For workers who are looking to commute, this area simply can't be beat.</p>
                <p>Also, it should be pointed out that this new complex is going to be very close to landmarks such as Washington Square. For history buffs and everyone who loves lore from the Revolutionary War — and beyond — these new homes could not be better situated. Independence Hall, Elfreth's Alley and a whole host of other amazing sites are just a short jaunt away.</p>
                <p>Of course, potential residents will also want to know about the interior of this exciting new development. Units are being built with the utmost care and attention. Kitchen details such as marble quartz countertops, Italian cabinetry and stone backsplashes make for a very modern aesthetic. With top-of-the-line appliances and details that catch the eye, these kitchens make a real statement. Indeed, it is the details that make the general living area appealing as well. It all starts with the lighting, which is recessed and features warmer tones. Roller shades allow the residents to control what kind of lighting they have in their unit on a daily basis. It's the Brazilian white oak floors, however, that may trigger the most compliments. Of course, sizable walk-in closets are always appealing as well. Again, the lighting adds a special, premium touch to the closet space.</p>
                <p>Adding to the aesthetic appeal of these units, one could make the case that the bathrooms are the standout feature of the entire place. Porcelain tile, huge vanities and integrated task letting set the mood. Then there's the large showers, which offer up high-pressure jet systems and waterfall rain shower heads. For those who are interested, some units will even feature bathtubs. These luxuriously appointed tubs, like all of the other bathroom features, add a special allure for those who choose to experience them.</p>
                <p>From top to bottom, these amazing new units have been designed and crafted to exceed new residents' most lofty expectations. In addition, their ideal location within the city makes this property one of the most-watched projects in PA real estate right now. For homebuyers who are craving something truly exceptional, this development is an extraordinary option.</p>
