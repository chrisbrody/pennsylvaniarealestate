                <h1>2630 West Girard Avenue in Brewerytown, North Philadelphia</h1>
                <p>Construction is underway at the Gio apartments at 2630 West Girard Avenue in the lively Brewerytown neighborhood of North Philadelphia. It is a five-story residential building housing more than 50 luxury units, which are available to lease as soon as today. These apartments are part of a broader complex that houses more than 100 additional residential units.</p>
                <p>Interface Studio Architects (ISA), a notable Philadelphia-based architectural firm, designed the building and entire complex. Callahan Ward, an award-winning and Philadelphia-based expert in urban residential development, oversaw all aspects of the construction. The construction company broke ground in 2023, completed the project in about a year, and did so at an estimated construction cost of $10 million.</p>
                <p>The location at 2630 West Girard is the centerpiece of the larger complex. It houses the more upscale apartments of the more than 150. The Gio features more upmarket amenities and more amenities overall than the neighboring sections. The developer dedicated 1,900 gross square footage to residential amenities. Those include a residential lounge, bike storage, a fitness center, a dog park, a secure package room, and secure on-site parking.</p>
                <p>As the inclusion of a dog park suggests, the Gio has a pet-friendly policy. It allows dogs and cats, up to two total with a one-time upfront fee and a a monthly rent add-on. The weight restriction is 100 pounds per pet. The apartment does have dog breed restrictions based on what it identifies as aggressive breeds.</p>

                <p>Another aspect of the Gio that makes it a neighborhood standout is the retail space at the ground level. The developer dedicated 9,300 gross square footage to the retail shops. It is important to note that as of this writing, the developer has not put the finishing touches on the retail space, but the shops are coming soon. There will be a mix of large, medium, and small spaces with a nice blend of major franchises and small businesses.</p>
                <p>There are 56 upscale apartments available in total. Of those, 75% or 42 are one-bedroom residences. The other 25% or 14 are two-bedroom units. The larger units are located at the corner of the building. This provides you with sunlight on two sides of the apartment. The smaller units have direct sunlight exposure as well. Marketing also promises sunlight exposure for all bedrooms in the smaller apartments and the primary bedrooms in the larger residences.</p>
                <p>All apartments have direct access outdoors. This includes private decks for both apartment sizes. Private roof decks, bi-level lofts, and two-story living rooms are available but not with all units. The interior elements are otherwise the same across units. You can expect modern stainless-steel appliances, including a dishwasher and in-unit washer and dryer. There is saffron chestnut wood flooring, quartz countertops, subway tile bathrooms, contemporary two-tone kitchen cabinets, two-tone tile kitchen backsplashes, sleek black bathroom fixtures, and spacious bedroom closets.</p>
                <p>The exterior has a modern aesthetic, one that melds well with the existing flavor of the area. It features a multi-toned design. For stoops and other ground surfaces, the builder used poured-in-place and sealed concrete. The lower facade and quads have a modular brick veneer colored red and brown. The second tier, along the roof decks and courtyard elevations, has fiber cement horizontal lap siding. Colors used for the lap siding vary between light gray, medium gray, and burnt orange. The third tier, along the upper facade and street fronting elevations, boasts corrugated metal siding with matching trim. The colors used for this top tier vary between light and dark gray.</p>
                <p>The construction at 2630 West Girard Avenue generated excitement early on among many in the Brewerytown area. This is a vibrant, diverse, and growing neighborhood, but the 2630 lot had sat undeveloped for a long time and seemed like wasted potential. Developers have not limited the revival of the area to this lot alone. There are other developments, including the 16-unit Bordeaux at 2600 West Girard Avenue.</p>
                <p>Residents of the Gio have convenient access to the 15 Girard Avenue trolley line. This line makes it easy to get to many popular areas within 15 minutes. That includes Center City, Fairmount Park, the Fairmount Avenue retail district, University City, and Temple University. The area is pedestrian- and bike-friendly too, and if you prefer to walk or ride, you can reach many of these areas within 30 minutes.</p>
