                <h1>Northern Liberties Getting Big Upgrade at 700-30 North Delaware</h1>
                <p>A historic area neighborhood is getting a long-overdue upgrade that could shape the future of its entire neighborhood.</p>
                <p>The land located at 700-30 North Delaware Avenue in the Northern Liberties section of North Philadelphia was once little more than a scattered group of vacant lots and a few small buildings. With some imagination, time, and hard work, the site is now home to a mixed-use development that straddles lines of form, function, and time.</p>

                <div class="caption">

                </div>

                <p>The sprawling property, which covers nearly three acres, includes two separate seven-story units with 466 units. The first is located at the North Delaware address, with the second situated at 711-35 North Front Street. The buildings flank the former Canal Street, which is now a pedestrian path providing convenient access for residents within the complex and to the existing riverfront trail via a 300' by 49' promenade path.</p>
                <p>The development features over 15,000 square feet of retail space and 488 residential spaces. These include 357 one-bedroom apartments, 72 two-bedroom apartments, and 59 studio apartments.</p>
                <p>The standout feature of the residential components of this complex is the level of amenities provided to residents. Spanning far beyond a simple concrete patio for small get-togethers, the three separate decks on the two buildings provide ample space for entertaining and socializing.</p>
                <p>On the east building, there is a deck atop the second floor that hosts a lawn area, bocce ball court, swimming pool, and landscaping. Five floors up, there is another deck adjoining the indoor club areas where residents and guests can spend the evening unwinding with a beautiful and unique view of the city and the Delaware River, including the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Elsewhere in the building, residents can also utilize a dog grooming facility, theater room, a test kitchen, and much more.</p>
                <p>Outdoor amenities extend onto the west building, which also has a deck on the seventh floor. Spanning 1,354 square feet, this space receives southern exposure year-round, providing evening warmth during every season and beautiful views of the city, bridge, and river.</p>
                <p>When a development is designed to include so many modern features, one might expect the design to be very trendy. While the dark trim work does provide a modern touch, the overall look still keeps a firm grasp on the traditional look of the neighborhood and Philadelphia in general. The exterior features Glen Gery brick in two different colors on all facades, tying the building in seamlessly with existing nearby structures. The cast stone headers and cornices evoke the city's colonial past, while three shades of metal trim inject a tasteful touch of current styles.</p>
                <p>That link to the past is evident in the 1830's-era structures located on the site. These seven classic rowhomes were in varying states of decline, but rather than raze them in favor of additional space for the new construction, the project instead rehabilitated them to enhance the project's connections to the past. With new windows and doors to provide improved appearance and performance, the rowhomes serve as a welcoming beacon on the southern aspect of the development, making a bold statement that the project is uniquely Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>No detail has gone unnoticed in planning the project. Even the landscaping has been carefully planned to provide the beauty one would expect with a new development, but in the context of native species that are found in and around Philadelphia naturally. The eastern redbud, black gum, swamp white oak, red maple, and other species chosen for the site help pull the development into the natural look of the city rather than forcing something new into the view and trying to make it look like it belongs there.</p>
                <p>With the influx of activity and commerce that 700-30 North Delaware is driving, the odds are good that other eyes will dream up possibilities for adjacent properties that will build real momentum for the entire area.</p>
                <p>Few developments receive the kind of thoughtful planning that has been put into the 700-30 North Delaware project. Not only has it created comfortable, modern housing for hundreds of residents, but it has also brought in commercial opportunities, distinctive architecture, natural beauty with native species, and the potential to drive improvements to the entire neighborhood. As the building continues to fill with residents and businesses, it will create an expanding impact on North Philadelphia that will last for decades to come.</p>
