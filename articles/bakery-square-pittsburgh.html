                <h1>Bakery Square Pittsburgh</h1>
                <p>Bakery Square sounds delicious, and it truly is in the wonderful variety of great dining, high-end shopping, hotels and events it offers residents and visitors. The area used to be a bakery and part of the Nabisco Factory. Today, it's considered the 34-acre gem of East Liberty and the surrounding neighborhoods. The proposed expansion would elevate the fine city of Pittsburgh to a whole new level and bring more tech companies into the arena.</p>
                <p>Walnut Capital had purchased the historic site in 2007 and ushered in a mixed-use complex of office space, retail space, hotel space and more. Over the years, it has flourished with a third office building and an additional parking garage. The reinventions are not over yet. Walnut Capital recently added the "Experience Center and Portal," a 10,000-square-foot event and meeting space with a cool pedestrian walkway.</p>
                <p>Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and other city officials are all for progress and want these projects to include a minimum of 10% of affordable units in each development.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Now, Walnut Capital is looking to almost double the size of Bakery Square to the tune of a half-billion-dollar price tag. Walnut Capital president Todd Reidbord told the media that more than 20 AI or Artificial Intelligence companies in Pittsburg would like to set down new office space in Bakery Square. It's where the action is, and these companies are looking for the green light. By the way, Google is a major tenant there.</p>
                <p>Folks who work in Bakery Square love it and rave about the diversity in the bustling development. The expansion of Bakery Square would bring even more people to the area to shop, dine and offer an abundance of new job opportunities for Pittsburgh's East End.</p>
                <p>According to the blueprint, the size of Bakery Square would increase by some 14 acres with retail and apartment complexes along Penn Avenue in East Liberty and Larimer. The City Planning Commission wants Walnut Capital to ensure adequate parking and sidewalk space under the new expansion plan.</p>
                <p>Reidbord has said that the Bakery Square project would not only be good for business but transformational to neighborhoods like Larimer. The plan would feature a community development agreement including more for-sale housing construction. Reidbord calls it "a legacy project" for his company and what it would give back to the community.</p>
                <p>Those who flock to Bakery Square enjoy visiting and/or working there because it is considered one of the most accessible areas of the entire city. For example, it's easy to get to Bakery Square thanks to public transportation or riding your bicycle. Four bike racks are available with two bike "fix-it" stations and a protected bicycle lane. In addition, South Garage is located on the Bakery Square premises with complimentary parking for two hours during weekdays, three hours after 5 p.m. and three hours on weekends. If you're there via electric vehicle, EV stations are available, so you can get a charge if needed.</p>
                <h2>Would you enjoy heading to Bakery Square? What would you find there?</h2>
                <p>The open-air layout adds a nice, modern touch to the neighborhood. Public spaces were also designed within the square, and you can enjoy visiting these spots without spending a dime. You could stop by the Conservatory featuring an open-air atrium composed of three stories. You could work on your laptop there or crack open a good book.</p>
                <p>When the weather's nice, the Bakery Square Courtyard is a favorite space with its comfy, large turf lawn and several recreational games available, including cornhole.</p>
                <p>There are weekly yoga sessions at Bakery Square happening all year round. Movie nights are free on the lawn. Bigger events also take prominence, including Tailgate on the Lawn and many more.</p>
                <p>Brand name clothes shopping and home decor stores can be found at the square, and the dining is off the charts, so delicious and aplenty!</p>
                <p>Bakery Square is a delightful and an excellent, modern concept. The new expansion is on its way, and many folks are looking forward to exciting possibilities.</p>
