                        <p>Real estate investment requires research, foresight, and timeliness. You have to know both what is happening and what will likely happen, and you have to strike when the iron is hot. Pittsburgh itself is replete with outstanding real estate investment opportunities.  The positive real estate trends don't just pertain to the residential real estate sector, however. There are more than 120 million square feet of commercial real estate in Pittsburgh, and despite a rising vacancy rate, absorption is increasing, indeed, many Class-B properties are being converted to residential and/or hospitality properties.</p>
